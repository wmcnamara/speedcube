If you know a cheat code, do this to trigger it.

1. Start a new game. Cheat codes can be inputted in the death screen or during a game. Not through the main menu.
2. Hold down each key of the code simultaniously. Timing, order and other parameters are irrelevant. If a codes corresponding buttons are pressed simultaniously, it will activate.
